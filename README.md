### Automated Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks with X-Ray Images

In this study, a deep learning model is proposed for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced an average classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. 

[X-ray images](https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19/tree/master/X-Ray%20Image%20DataSet) obtained from two different sources were used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. A COVID-19 X-ray image [database](https://github.com/ieee8023/COVID-chestxray-dataset/)  was developed by Cohen JP using images from various open access sources. This database is constantly updated with images shared by researchers from different regions. Also, the [ChestX-ray8 database](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) provided by Wang et al. was used for normal and pneumonia images. In order to avoid the unbalanced data problem, we used 500 no-findings and 500 pneumonia class frontal chest X-ray images randomly from this database. Please see our [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340935440_Automated_Detection_of_COVID-19_Cases_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_X-ray_Images) for the details.
